# About me
I am a student of the fourth year of LNU, faculty of VMB, I study on a specialty law. I have always been interested in the world of IT, news and new technologies, but at the entrance I decided that programming is not my thing and chose law. Recently I found out about RS School and decided to try myself to see if I could do it.
